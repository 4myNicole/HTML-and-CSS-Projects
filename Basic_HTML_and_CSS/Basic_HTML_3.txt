The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. 
It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. <br>
The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). <br>
Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the coypu. <br>
The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals,<br> but usually lives in groups of 10â€“20 individuals. 
The capybara is not a threatened species and it is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.

<p>
Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,as well as fruit and tree bark.<br>
They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. <br>
They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, <br>
they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, <br>
so they are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.<br>
Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, <br>
and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, <br>
the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously
